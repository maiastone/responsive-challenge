##Havenly Responsive Challenge

###Instructions
Build the following page design to match the responsive.png mock-up as closely as you can. We don't have a mobile mock for this page, but be sure to build it mobile-first and make your own decisions about how to display the layout at that size.

The page shown on the mock is the max-width - if a user's screen is wider than 1150px, the page should be the size shown and centered in the browser.
